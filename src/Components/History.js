        The Premier League, often referred to as the English Premier League or the EPL outside England,<br />
        is the top level of the English football league system.Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a <br />
        system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League
        <br />
        
        The Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from <br />
        August to May with each team playing 38 matches (both home and away). Most games are played on <br />
        Saturday and Sunday afternoons.<br />
        The competition was formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of <br />
        clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League,<br />
        founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal.<br />
        <br/>
        The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories <br/>
        to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018â€“19 season average <br/>
        Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, second to the Bundesliga's 43,500. <br/>
